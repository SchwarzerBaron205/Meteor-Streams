# Meteor-Streams

This repository contains project for calculating meteor showers.

ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate) is the number of meteors per hour that we could see if the meteor shower radiant was at the zenith and the sky was clear.

The program receives a file with the stellar magnitudes of meteors and calculates:

1. The number of all meteors in the file;
2. The number of bolids;
3. The numbers of meteors having a stellar magnitude m;
4. The mean popilation index of meteor shower;
5. The zenith hourly rates for each hour of observations;
6. The mean zenithal horly rate per night;
7. The sample variance of data;
8. The corrected sample variance of data;
9. The deviation from the norm;
